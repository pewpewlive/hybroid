# Livecode

A programming language tailored for PewPew Live level development.

While it is primarily designed for making PPL levels, it supports generic Lua environment and other environments in the future.

## Syntax

The preliminary syntax for Livecode can be found [here](spec/syntax.md).

## Syntax highlighting

An experimental VS Code extension is available [here](https://github.com/pewpewlive/livecode-vscode).

## Goals

- [ ] Full spec

- [ ] Working lexer

- [ ] Working parser

- [ ] Working AST walker

- [ ] Simple Lua codegen

- [ ] Advanced codegen

- [ ] Language server and syntax highlighting

- [ ] Support for other environments (such as `GoGeneric` or `PyGeneric`)
