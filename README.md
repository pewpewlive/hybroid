# Hybroid

A programming language tailored for PewPew Live level development.

While it is primarily designed for making PPL levels, it also supports generic Lua environment and will support other environments in the future.

## Notice

As Hybroid is still in alpha, the language features may have breaking changes when updating. This notice will be removed once the language goes into a stable state.

## Syntax

The preliminary syntax for Hybroid can be found [here](spec/syntax.md).

## Syntax highlighting

An experimental VS Code extension is available [here](https://github.com/pewpewlive/hybroid-vscode).

## Goals

- [ ] Full spec

- [x] Working lexer

- [ ] Working parser

- [ ] Working AST walker

- [x] Basic Lua codegen

- [ ] Advanced codegen

- [ ] Language server and syntax highlighting

- [ ] Support for other environments (such as `GoGeneric` or `PyGeneric`)
